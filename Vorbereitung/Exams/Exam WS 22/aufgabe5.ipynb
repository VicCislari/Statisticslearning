    "(a) **Unbiased Estimator of Prevalence:**  \n",
    "   - To demonstrate that \\( X = \\frac{m}{n} \\) is an unbiased estimator of prevalence, we need to show that the expected value of \\( X \\) equals the true prevalence \\( p \\).\n",
    "   - The true prevalence \\( p \\) is the proportion of individuals in the population who have the disease.\n",
    "   - Since the sample is drawn randomly, each individual has the same probability of being selected, which is \\( p \\).\n",
    "   - Therefore, the expected value of \\( X \\) is equal to \\( p \\), making \\( X \\) an unbiased estimator of prevalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Variance of the Estimator \\( X \\):**  \n",
    "   - The variance of \\( X \\), denoted by \\( \\text{Var}(X) \\), is calculated using the variance formula for the binomial distribution.\n",
    "   - The variance \\( \\text{Var}(X) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} \\), where \\( p \\) is the true prevalence and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **Upper 95% Confidence Bound for Prevalence:**  \n",
    "   - For a large enough sample size \\( n \\), a normal approximation can be used to calculate the upper 95% confidence bound for prevalence.\n",
    "   - The standard error of \\( X \\) is \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\), and the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is \\( 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\).\n",
    "   - Adding the margin of error to \\( X \\) gives the upper bound: \\( X + \\text{ME} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) **Minimum Sample Size for Desired Confidence Bound:**  \n",
    "   - To find the minimum sample size needed for the upper 95% confidence bound to be 0.01 greater than the estimate, an inequality is set up and solved for \\( n \\).\n",
    "   - This involves iterating through possible values of \\( n \\) until the inequality holds, considering the constraint that prevalence is ≤0.1.\n",
    "   - The normal approximation for the confidence bound is used in this calculation.\n"
