# Task 1:  Calculate the following quantities:
# sum of 52.3, 74.8, 3.17
52.3+74.8+3.17
# the square root of 144
144**0.5
# the 10-based logarithm of 200 multiplied with sin of $\pi/4$
log10(200)*sin(pi/4)
# the cumulative sum of the numbers 1,3,18,20,2 
cumsum(c(1,3,18,20,2))
# find 10 numbers between 0 and 20 rounded to the nearest
sample(x = 0:20, size = 10, replace = FALSE)

# Task 2: Assigning Variables
# Assign the number 5 to x and the number 10 to y.
x <- 5
y <- 10
# Calculate the product of x and y.
x * y
# Store the result in a new variable z.

# Inspect your workspace by clicking the ``environment'' tab in RStudio, and find the three objects.

# Make a vector myvec of the objects x,y,z.

# Task 3 rainfall in the first ten days in a year

# Task 5: Inspect the R commands union(), setdiff() and intersect()

# Task 6 Construct a matrix with 8 rows and 10 columns. The first row should
