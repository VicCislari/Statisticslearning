# Task 1: Calculate the following quantities:

# sum of 52.3, 74.8, 3.17
52.3 + 74.8 + 3.17

# the square root of 144
sqrt(144)

# the 10-based logarithm of 200 multiplied with sin of Ï€/4
log10(200) * sin(pi/4)

# the cumulative sum of the numbers 1, 3, 18, 20, 2
cumsum(c(1, 3, 18, 20, 2))

# find 10 numbers between 0 and 20 rounded to the nearest integer
sample(x = 0:20, size = 10, replace = FALSE)
# or
round(runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 20))
